# Voice-LLM CRUD System Development Plan

## Phase 1: Basic Voice Input and Command Processing

### Frontend Tasks

1. Implement basic voice input capture using Web Speech API
2. Create a simple UI for initiating voice commands and displaying results
3. Set up API service to send voice input to backend

### Backend Tasks

1. Create a new API endpoint to receive voice command text
2. Implement basic LLM integration (e.g., with OpenAI's API)
3. Develop a simple command interpreter for the LLM's output

## Phase 2: Core CRUD Functionality

### Frontend Tasks

1. Enhance UI to display more detailed feedback about operations
2. Implement error handling for failed API calls or invalid commands

### Backend Tasks

1. Extend command interpreter to handle basic CRUD operations
2. Implement database operations based on interpreted commands
3. Create response generator for operation results
4. Add error handling for invalid operations or database errors

## Phase 3: Refinement and Advanced Features

### Frontend Tasks

1. Implement continuous listening mode (if desired)
2. Add visual feedback for ongoing processes (e.g., loading indicators)
3. Implement optional text-to-speech for responses

### Backend Tasks

1. Refine LLM prompts for better command understanding
2. Implement more complex command parsing (e.g., multiple items, queries)
3. Add support for inventory-specific operations (e.g., low stock alerts)
4. Implement logging and monitoring for voice commands

## Phase 4: Security and Optimization

### Frontend Tasks

1. Implement secure token handling for authenticated requests
2. Optimize voice input processing for better performance

### Backend Tasks

1. Integrate voice command processing with existing authentication system
2. Implement rate limiting for voice commands
3. Optimize database queries for faster response times

## Phase 5: Testing and Polishing

### Frontend Tasks

1. Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. Conduct usability testing and refine UI/UX based on feedback

### Backend Tasks

1. Implement unit and integration tests for all new components
2. Conduct load testing and optimize for scalability

### General Tasks

1. End-to-end testing of the entire voice command flow
2. Documentation of the voice command system for users and developers
3. Final security audit of the entire system

## Getting Started

To begin the development process, we recommend starting with the following tasks:

### Frontend Initial Task

- Set up a basic React component for voice input capture
- Implement the Web Speech API for speech-to-text conversion

### Backend Initial Task

- Create a new Express route for receiving voice command text
- Set up a basic integration with an LLM service (e.g., OpenAI)

These initial steps will establish the fundamental flow from voice input to LLM processing, providing a solid foundation to build upon as we progress through the development phases.
