# Express Application Structure and Flow

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the structure and flow of our Express application. The application follows a modular architecture, separating concerns into different layers for better maintainability and scalability.

## Directory Structure

├── app.ts                 # Main application file

├── database/              # Database configuration

## Application Flow

1. **Entry Point (app.ts)**
   - Sets up the Express application
   - Configures middleware (cors, json parsing)
   - Initializes database connection
   - Mounts route handlers

2. **Routes**
   - Define the API endpoints
   - Map HTTP methods and URLs to specific controller methods

3. **Controllers**
   - Handle HTTP requests and responses
   - Validate input data
   - Call appropriate service methods
   - Send responses back to the client

4. **Services**
   - Contain the core business logic
   - Interact with models to perform database operations
   - Handle complex operations and data transformations

5. **Models**
   - Define the structure of database entities
   - Provide an interface for database operations

6. **Middleware**
   - Perform operations on requests before they reach route handlers
   - Can modify request/response objects or end the request-response cycle

## Detailed Flow Example

Let's follow the flow of a request to create a new user:

1. A POST request is sent to `/api/users`

2. The request first passes through global middleware in `app.ts` (cors, json parsing)

3. `userRoutes.ts` routes the request to the appropriate controller method:
   ```typescript
   router.post('/', UserController.createUser);
````

4. `UserController.createUser` method is invoked:

   - Extracts data from the request body
   - Calls the `UserService.createUser` method

5. `UserService.createUser` method:

   - Performs any necessary business logic (e.g., password hashing)
   - Uses the `User` model to create a new user in the database

6. The `User` model interacts with the database to create a new record

7. The result propagates back up the chain:
   - Service returns the created user to the controller
   - Controller sends a response back to the client

## Authentication Flow

1. User logs in by sending a POST request to `/api/auth/login`

2. `AuthController.login` method is invoked

3. `AuthService.login` verifies credentials and generates a JWT token

4. Token is sent back to the client

5. For subsequent requests to protected routes:
   - The `authenticateToken` middleware verifies the token
   - If valid, the request proceeds to the route handler
   - If invalid, an error response is sent back

## Conclusion

This modular structure allows for:

- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing and maintenance
- Scalability as the application grows

Each component has a specific responsibility:

- Routes define the API structure
- Controllers handle HTTP logic
- Services contain business logic
- Models represent data and database operations

This architecture promotes code reusability and helps in managing the complexity of the application as it grows.
