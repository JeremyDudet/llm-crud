# Inventory Management Voice-LLM Workflow

## 1. Voice Input

User says: "We have 10 gallons of whole milk"

## 2. Speech-to-Text Conversion

Convert the spoken words to text.

## 3. LLM Processing

Send the text to the LLM with a prompt that includes:

Context about being an inventory management system
Instructions to identify key elements: action (add/update), quantity, unit, and item
Request to format the output in a structured manner

## 4. LLM Output

The LLM should return a structured output, for example:

```json
{
  "action": "add",
  "quantity": 10,
  "unit": "gallons",
  "item": "whole milk"
}
```

## 5. Backend Processing

Validate the LLM output
Check if the item exists in the inventory
If it exists, update the quantity
If it doesn't exist, create a new entry

## 6. Database Operation

Perform the appropriate CRUD operation based on the processed information

## 7. Confirmation

Generate a confirmation message, e.g., "Added 10 gallons of whole milk to the inventory"

## 8. (Optional) Text-to-Speech

Convert the confirmation message back to speech

## 9. Error Handling Scenarios

Ambiguous input: "We have milk" (missing quantity)
Unknown item: "We have 5 boxes of widgets" (item not in database)
Incorrect unit: "We have 10 pounds of milk"

Handling Complex Scenarios

Multiple items: "We have 10 gallons of whole milk and 5 loaves of bread"
Removal: "Remove 3 gallons of whole milk from inventory"
Stock check: "How much whole milk do we have?"
Low stock alert: "Alert me when we have less than 5 gallons of whole milk"

## 10. Voice-LLM CRUD System Architecture

Frontend (React SPA)

## 11. Voice Input Capture

Implement using the Web Speech API or a similar library
Responsible for capturing user's voice and converting it to text

## 12. User Interface

Display feedback, confirmations, and results to the user
Optionally, implement text-to-speech for responses

## 13. API Communication

Send processed voice commands to the backend
Receive and display responses from the backend

## 14. Backend (Express.js)

## 15. Voice Command API Endpoint

Receive text-based commands from the frontend

## 16. LLM Integration

Communicate with the chosen LLM service (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4)
Process the LLM's response

## 17. Command Interpretation

Parse the LLM's output into actionable instructions

## 18. CRUD Operation Execution

Perform the interpreted CRUD operations on the database

## 19. Response Generation

Create user-friendly responses based on the operation results

## 20. Existing Authentication and Authorization

Leverage current auth system to secure voice-based operations

## 21. Shared Responsibilities

## 22. Error Handling

Frontend: Display user-friendly error messages
Backend: Generate detailed error information

## 23. Logging and Monitoring

Frontend: Log user interactions and any client-side issues
Backend: Log detailed operation information and any server-side issues

## 24. External Services

## 25. LLM Service (e.g., OpenAI)

Hosted externally, communicated with from the backend

## 26. Database

Existing database setup, interacted with from the backend
