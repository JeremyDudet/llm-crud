Inventory Management Voice-LLM Workflow

1. Voice Input
   User says: "We have 10 gallons of whole milk"
2. Speech-to-Text Conversion
   Convert the spoken words to text.
3. LLM Processing
   Send the text to the LLM with a prompt that includes:

Context about being an inventory management system
Instructions to identify key elements: action (add/update), quantity, unit, and item
Request to format the output in a structured manner

4. LLM Output
   The LLM should return a structured output, for example:
   jsonCopy{
   "action": "add",
   "quantity": 10,
   "unit": "gallons",
   "item": "whole milk"
   }
5. Backend Processing

Validate the LLM output
Check if the item exists in the inventory
If it exists, update the quantity
If it doesn't exist, create a new entry

6. Database Operation
   Perform the appropriate CRUD operation based on the processed information
7. Confirmation
   Generate a confirmation message, e.g., "Added 10 gallons of whole milk to the inventory"
8. (Optional) Text-to-Speech
   Convert the confirmation message back to speech
   Error Handling Scenarios

Ambiguous input: "We have milk" (missing quantity)
Unknown item: "We have 5 boxes of widgets" (item not in database)
Incorrect unit: "We have 10 pounds of milk"

Handling Complex Scenarios

Multiple items: "We have 10 gallons of whole milk and 5 loaves of bread"
Removal: "Remove 3 gallons of whole milk from inventory"
Stock check: "How much whole milk do we have?"
Low stock alert: "Alert me when we have less than 5 gallons of whole milk"
